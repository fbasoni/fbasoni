### OlÃ¡, hola, hello.
Welcome!ğŸ‘‹

I'm Fabi, once upon a time a linguist, currently on a self teaching web development journey, studying front-end web development @Laboratoria. 
I am absolutely fascinated about human interaction through technology, and take keen interest in natural language processing.
